- **Techniques**: Collaborative Filtering, Content-based Filtering, Clustering, Hybrid Methods
- **Use Case**: E-commerce personalization and targeted marketing

### 3. ü§ñ Product Automation (Smart Catalog Enrichment)
- **Purpose**: Automatically tag and price new products
- **Techniques**: TF-IDF + Similarity, Multi-label Classification, Price Prediction
- **Use Case**: Automated product onboarding and catalog management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the ml_service directory**:
```bash
cd ml_service
```

2. **Activate virtual environment**:
```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):
```bash

```

The service will be available at: `http://localhost:8001`

## üìö API Documentation

Once the service is running, visit:
- **Interactive API Docs**: `http://localhost:8001/docs`
- **Alternative Docs**: `http://localhost:8001/redoc`
- **Complete Demo Guide**: `http://localhost:8001/demo/complete-workflow`

## üî¨ Research Scenarios

### Getting Started with Demo Data

1. **Train All Models** (takes 2-5 minutes):
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/models/train-all"
```

2. **Check Training Status**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/models/status"
```

### 1. Security Analysis Research

#### Test Different Attack Patterns
```bash
# Get demo attack scenarios
curl "http://localhost:8001/security/demo-attacks"

# Analyze XSS attack
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/security/analyze" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "path": "/api/search?q=<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>",
    "method": "GET",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100"
  }'

# Analyze SQL Injection
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/security/analyze" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "path": "/api/products?id=1\" UNION SELECT password FROM users--",
    "method": "GET",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
    "ip_address": "10.0.0.50"
  }'
```

#### Research Questions:
- How accurate is the multi-layered detection approach?
- Which ML technique performs best for each attack type?
- How do false positive rates compare across methods?

### 2. Recommendation System Research

#### Test Regional and Demographic Differences
```bash
# Get demo users from different segments
curl "http://localhost:8001/recommendations/demo-users"

# Get recommendations for EU user (young)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/recommendations/get" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "num_recommendations": 10,
    "strategy": "hybrid"
  }'

# Compare with different strategies
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/recommendations/get" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "strategy": "collaborative"
  }'
```

#### Analyze User Segments
```bash
# Get user clustering analysis
curl "http://localhost:8001/recommendations/segments"

# Get personalized deals
curl "http://localhost:8001/recommendations/deals/user_123"
```

#### Research Questions:
- How do recommendations differ across regions (EU vs NA vs Asia)?
- What's the impact of age groups on recommendation quality?
- How effective is the hybrid approach vs individual methods?
- How do user clusters correlate with purchasing behavior?

### 3. Product Automation Research

#### Test Automated Product Analysis
```bash
# Get demo products
curl "http://localhost:8001/products/demo-products"

# Analyze a new product
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/products/analyze" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
    "description": "High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation, 30-hour battery life, and premium sound quality."
  }'

# Get category insights
curl "http://localhost:8001/products/category/electronics"
```

#### Research Questions:
- How accurate is automatic category prediction?
- What's the effectiveness of ML vs rule-based tag suggestions?
- How close are price estimations to market prices?
- Which product features most influence pricing?

    labels=your_attack_labels
)

# Example: Train with custom product data
product_automation.train(
    products_data=your_product_catalog
)
```
